## Design

### Theme

A [bootstrap template Impact](https://bootstrapmade.com/impact-bootstrap-business-website-template/download/) was used for this project. I also utilised another [bootstrap template Admin](https://bootstrapmade.com/nice-admin-bootstrap-admin-html-template/) for the login/logout and forms of the site. I adapted and pulled aspects of the code for the website and changed CSS elements to better represent my vision for the vintage online shop.

### Colour 

I chose red, black, and white as the main colours for my website because these colors blend well together, creating an attractive and cohesive look. Red connects with the "preloved" theme of my shop, and the fractured black heart logo reinforces this, symbolizing affection for vintage items that may have seen some wear and tear. Additionally, I like the use black and white as they pay tribute to times gone by, adding a nostalgic and timeless feel to the website.

### Javascript - [JSHint](https://jshint.com/)
- The js included in this project is from the [bootstrap template Impact](https://bootstrapmade.com/impact-bootstrap-business-website-template/download/). I did not adapt this code in anyway hence I did not try to fiddle with it and mess up its functionality by trying to fulfil all the validation checks.
