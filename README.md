## Design

### Theme

A [bootstrap template ]() was used for this project. I also utilised another [bootstrap template Admin](https://bootstrapmade.com/nice-admin-bootstrap-admin-html-template/) for the login/logout and forms of the site. I adapted and pulled aspects of the code for the website and changed CSS elements to better represent my vision for the vintage online shop.
